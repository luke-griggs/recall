We're trying to shape the interaction and the fundamental experience

I'm using my conversations with Claude as a reference point

some things that I would change if I could
- I'd like the model to ask me more questions that make me think deeply
- For technical conversations I'd like supplementary math/coding questions
- Go down a quick rabbit hole then return back to where I was
- "here's how this relates to this other thing"
- Robust tracking of my understanding
- Knowing the books that I read
- Ability to upload materials

- If a conversation covers multiple subject areas, there should be connections between them

- helper in a sidebar for me to ask quick questions


- Initial interface is just a voice input 
- Journal associated with that topic that contains transcripts/typed explanations





A. Verbal explanation (spoken aloud)

Explain the concept out loud, as if teaching someone
Record yourself (audio or video)
Notice where you stumble or say "um" - those are conceptual gaps

Why: Forces linear, coherent articulation. You can't skip steps when speaking.
B. Visual diagram (drawn from memory)

Draw the concept without references
Use boxes, arrows, hierarchies, whatever makes sense
Label relationships, not just components

Why: Forces structural understanding. Exposes how components relate spatially/temporally.
C. Written explanation (typed/handwritten)

Write out the explanation in prose
Try to make it as clear and precise as possible
Use specific examples

Why: Writing allows more careful word choice than speaking. You can refine as you go.
D. Physical gesture/metaphor

Use hand movements to explain the concept
Embody the mechanism physically
Create a spatial metaphor with your body

Why: Engages sensorimotor systems. Particularly powerful for concepts involving movement, flow, or transformation.
E. Worked example (problem-solving)
Apply the concept to solve an actual problem
Work through the steps manually
Show your work
